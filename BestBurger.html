    <div class="main"><h3>Description</h3></div>

    <p>
      Just a Burger? Just a burger. , it's so much more than "just a burger." I
      mean... that first bite-oh, what heaven that first bite is. The bun, like
      a sesame freckled breast of an angel, resting gently on the ketchup and
      mustard below, flavors mingling in a seductive <em>pas de deux</em>.
    </p>

    <p>
      And then... a pickle! The most playful little pickle! Then a slice of
      tomato, a leaf of lettuce and a... a patty of ground beef so exquisite,
      swirling in your mouth, breaking apart, and combining again in a fugue of
      sweets and savor so delightful.

      This is no mere sandwich of grilled meat and toasted bread, Robin.
      <strong>This is God, speaking to us in food</strong>.

    <div class="main"><h3>Ingredients</h3></div>

    <!--this is just a comment for practice-->
    <ul>
      <li>500g good-quality beef mince</li>
      <li>1 small onion, diced</li>
      <li>1 egg</li>
      <li>1 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
      <li>4 burger buns</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="main"><h3>Preparation</h3></div>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Tip 500g beef mince into a bowl with 1 small diced onion and 1 egg, then
        mix.
      </li>

      <li>
        Divide the mixture into four. Lightly wet your hands. Carefully roll the
        mixture into balls, each about the size of a tennis ball.
      </li>

      <li>
        Set in the palm of your hand and gently squeeze down to flatten into
        patties about 3cm thick. Make sure all the burgers are the same
        thickness so that they will cook evenly.
      </li>

      <li>
        Put on a plate, cover with cling film and leave in the fridge to firm up
        for at least 30 mins.
      </li>

      <li>
        Heat the barbecue to medium hot (there will be white ash over the red
        hot coals – about 40 mins after lighting). Lightly brush one side of
        each burger with vegetable oil.
      </li>

      <li>
        Place the burgers, oil-side down, on the barbecue. Cook for 5 mins until
        the meat is lightly charred. Don’t move them around or they may stick.
      </li>

      <li>
        Oil the other side, then turn over using tongs. Don’t press down on the
        meat, as that will squeeze out the juices.
      </li>

      <li>
        Cook for 5 mins more for medium. If you like your burgers pink in the
        middle, cook 1 min less each side. For well done, cook 1 min more.
      </li>

      <li>
        Take the burgers off the barbecue. Leave to rest on a plate so that all
        the juices can settle inside
      </li>

      <li>
        Slice four burger buns in half. Place, cut-side down, on the barbecue
        rack and toast for 1 min until they are lightly charred. Place a burger
        inside each bun, then top with your choice of accompaniment.
      </li>
    </ol>
