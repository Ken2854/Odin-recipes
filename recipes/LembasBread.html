<img src="../images/LembasBread1.gif" alt="2 hobbits eating bread">

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The bread was very nutritious, stayed fresh for months when wrapped in <em>mallorn</em> leaves, and was used for sustenance on long journeys. Lembas was light brown on the outside, and the color of cream on the inside.</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>

<ul>
<li>2 1/2 c
    all purpose flour</li>
<li>1 Tbsp
    baking powder</li>
<li>1/4 tsp
    salt</li>
<li>1/2 c
    butter</li>
<li>1/3 c
    brown sugar</li>
<li>1 tsp
    cinnamon</li>
<li>1/2 tsp
    honey</li>
<li>2/3 c
    heavy whipping cream</li>
<li>1/2 tsp
    vanilla extract</li>

</ul>

<h3>Preparation</h3>

<ol>
<li>Preheat oven to 425F. Mix the flour, baking powder and salt into a large bowl. Add the butter and mix with a well till fine granules (easiest way is with an electric mixer). Then add the sugar and cinnamon, and mix them thoroughly.</li>
<li>Finally add the cream, honey, and vanilla and stir them in with a fork until a nice, thick dough forms.</li>
<li>Roll the dough out about 1/2 in thickness. Cut out 3-inch squares and transfer the dough to a cookie sheet.Criss-cross each square from corner-to-corner with a knife, lightly (not cutting through the dough).</li>
<li>Bake for about 12 minutes or more (depending on the thickness of the bread) until it is set and lightly golden.</li>
<li>Let cool completely before eating, this bread tastes better room temperature and dry. Also for more flavor you can add more cinnamon or other spices</li>
